# Main monit configuration file
## On most Linux distributions, this lives at /etc/monit/monitrc, although your distro may vary
## On FreeBSD this is at /usr/local/etc/monitrc

## Note: this monitrc file *must* have permissions set to 600, else monit complains

# Run a check every 30 seconds, log to a file
set daemon  30
set logfile /var/log/monit.log

# Our monit web dashboard configuration
set httpd
    port 2812
    use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
    # allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server
    allow yourusername:yourchosenpasswordshouldbedifficulttoguess


# check database service
check host localmysql with address 127.0.0.1
    if failed ping then alert        
    if failed port 3306 protocol mysql then alert


# nginx
check process nginx with pidfile /var/run/nginx.pid
    start program = "/etc/init.d/nginx start"
    stop program  = "/etc/init.d/nginx stop"
    group www-data


# php-fpm
## Depending on your version of Unix or Linux, this path could be different. If you're unsure, just do a 'ls -alh /var/run/'

check process phpfpm with pidfile /var/run/php-fpm.pid
      if cpu > 50% for 2 cycles then alert
      # if total cpu > 60% for 5 cycles then restart
      if memory > 300 MB then alert
      # if total memory > 500 MB then restart




# include files for individual sites
## this path is for Ubuntu -- it can change, depending on which Linux/Unix OS you're using
include /etc/monit/monit.d/*
